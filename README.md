COMP272 Programming Assignment 3

This repository is to be used for programming assignemnt #3. The Main.java file is the main driver which performs the testing. Do *NOT* modify this file. You must pass all supplied tests that are currently contained in the file Main.java to get full credit. 

The AVLTree.java file is the source code for the AVL tree object. As described in the Assignemnt 3 (discussed in the provided PDF), you are to complete the private method DeleteElement. Read the comments in the prologue (comment block) for this method for the logic that needs to be coded. 

The TreeProblems.java file contains three methods that must be coded. These are not difficult and need to use the TreeSet and TreeMap classes, as appropriate, in the Java Collections Framework library. 

Difficultly level / Grading: 
The TreeProblems should be easy and all tests must be passed that will provide a grade potential of 80%. To get the additional 20% of the grade to achieve 100%, all tests must pass for the AVL Tree. The difficulty level of this method is medium.
